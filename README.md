# WWH_Replication
Replication Data for EMSE paper "The Who-What-How of Software Engineering Research"

# Coding Spreadsheet
The Coding spreadsheet, including codes for Who, What, and How, is available as a Google Spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DsOavxgFD8eWddG6bBjgWUQu4j10N2ioSJbHxrqpPIc/edit?usp=sharing

Included in the spreadsheet are per-cell comments for most of the coded data. These comments represent quotations or evidence directly from the paper for that code.

# Analysis Scripts
analysis.Rmd is an RMarkdown notebook for running analysis and filtering scripts.

# CSV Files
To ease use of the analysis script, we include CSV of our coding from the Google Spreadsheet.
